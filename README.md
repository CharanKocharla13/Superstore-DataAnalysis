## Introduction

In today's competitive business landscape, understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and market trends is crucial for success. This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of the Superstore data to gain valuable insights that can drive business decisions.

The main analysis file is [superstoreanalysis.ipynb](superstoreanalysis.ipynb). It is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code, explanations, and visualizations for the analysis. The notebook walks through various steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and deriving insights from the Superstore dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the [SampleSuperstore.csv](SampleSuperstore.csv) file, which is available in the repository. It represents the sales data of a retail store and includes information about sales transactions, customers, products, regions, and other relevant attributes.

## Installation

To run the analysis code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharanKocharla13/Superstore-DataAnalysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Superstore-DataAnalysis
```

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository and navigated to the project directory, you can open and run the [superstoreanalysis.ipynb](superstoreanalysis.ipynb) file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for the analysis, along with explanations and code snippets.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results and visualize the insights derived from the Superstore data.
